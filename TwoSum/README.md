# Two Sum Problem

This code contains a function that finds two indices of numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. There may be many ways to get the sum, but the programme gives the first option.

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

Output: [1,2]

## Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]
